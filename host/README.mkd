# Host utilities

## Acquire tool

The `openpd-acquire` tool is a small utility for acquiring samples from the OpenPD.
It will output a tab-separated file of power and an optional timestamp (given in
UNIX epoch time).

For instance,
```bash
$ openpd-acquire --timestamps
1430280904.436060	8.97e-10
1430280904.938442	8.92e-10
1430280905.441401	8.89e-10
```

## Daemon

The `openpd-daemon` script provides a simple abstraction layer for allowing
concurrent access to one or more OpenPD devices by multiplier users.

The daemon exposes a ZeroMQ `REP` socket on `tcp://127.0.0.1:9276`. Users can
submit requests in the form of JSON objects to this socket. The reply will be
returned in the form of a JSON object. The known commands are,

* list known devices:
    * request: `{type: 'list-devices'}`
    * response: `{devices: ['device-id-1', 'device-id-2', ...]}`
* sample a device:
    * request: `{type: 'sample', device: 'device-id-1'}`
    * response: `{power: 1.4e-6, range: 3}` (power in watts)
