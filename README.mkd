OpenPD — Open-source photodiode amplifier
=========================================

OpenPD is a low-cost, high dynamic range photodiode amplifier,
designed for use as a low-bandwidth laser power meter. The device can
be used either autonomously or as a USB device.

The device is built using easy-to-solder 0805 surface mount
passives. The device consists of a compensated transimpedance
amplifier with a wide range gains, switched with a network of analog
multiplexers. Since dual amplifiers are cheap, an additional voltage
gain stage is included after the transimpedance amplifier, providing
another factor of 10 in gain (albeit with the addition noise that this
implies).

Note that the capacitance and leakage current of these multiplexers
limit the frequency response and low-current linearity of the
device. This is acceptable for the intended use-case, which targets
general purpose intensity measurements of constant-wave lasers.

The Hamamatsu S2281 photodiode is a convenient photodiode for use with
this device.

The device is designed using the [gEDA][] electronic design suite.
